I'm a domain owner; as a matter of fact, I have three domains registered for personal use: canonni.com, stusoc.com, and of course, canonni.website. It is important to note that domains, despite their deceptive name, are not directly connected with websites. For that reason, only [canonni.website](canonni.website) is live on the web, and the others are all in some state of dormancy.

Within these tiny plots of internet, their owners have absolute freedom of what they are used for. Some choose to trade memorable domains, others decide to set up custom email addresses with them, but, most commonly, people host websites connected to their domain.

I have made myself a member of the common people. By hosting this static website via AWS' S3 buckets, I have turned my domain into a personal blog. Yet, I could've made it anything else: media platform, online store, and even a porn site.

A domain, once bought, is permanently registered with the ICANN, a UN-subsidiary organization tasked with managing the entire internet. This means that, in theory, the entire internet is private property, and that, when I inevitably die, this domain and all of its contents are directly transferred to my next-in-line.

What I encourage you to do is get a domain for yourself. It doesn't have to be content-rich, memorable, or even functional, as, no matter what, your domain is the only thing on the internet that is truly yours, free of corporate intervention and government surveillance.

A domain only costs around a day's meal money and lasts forever. In these tiny plots on the internet, you are the king and have absolute discretion regarding its purpose. That is why, at least in my humble opinion, domains are great.
