Yesterday I've implemented the comments feacture, powered using the [Valine](https://valine.js.org/en/index.html) framework.

All comments are stored on a [SQL](https://www.iso.org/standard/76583.html) database, which means, by running two simple UPDATE commands, I can do things similar to the Ministry of Truth in _Nineteen Eighty-four_. I'm not saying I would, just that it is possible, if I ever decide to do so.

All articles, including this one, now support commenting. The UI is rather hideous, but hey, Good Fast Beautiful, pick two out of three. I picked the first two. The UI may change drastically in the future, but the database will remain the same for backwards compatibility.

So, enjoy. Say whatever you want to say, whether it's criticism, feedback, humorous, hateful, or even brainrot. This blog is where freedom of speech takes place.
