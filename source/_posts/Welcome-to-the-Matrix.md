Welcome to my blog! This site, created using the Hexo framework, is where I semi-regularly post new articles, essays, and random thoughts.

I believe in two rights: that of information and privacy. For that reason, most articles, including this one, welcome your comments; if you would like to hide your personal information for whatever reason, feel free to make it anonymous.

Again, welcome, and sorry in advance for making your eyes bleed. One last thing, if you encounter any errors while using this site, please report them by messaging me on any platform, thanks.
