In nearly all highly-developed countries, the market retains absolute freedom; even when all three branches of government pass worthless documents attempting to regulate companies, they can still continue walking on their existing path.

In modern societies, everyone's lives are shaped by companies with monopolies in their respective industries. In some more extreme cases, especially in East Asia, companies act as if they're one's parents and seemlessly intergrate themselves with ordinary people's day-to-day living. For example, both Microsoft and Apple, whose browsers you're likely using to read this article, are considered monopolies by the Federal Trade Commission, and consumers who purchase their products depend on said products.

During the past week, I have experienced and purchased products from several tech monopolies for personal use. The most important conclusion I have drew from my short experience is that, no matter how much of their budget is spend towards packaging themselves as something else, all of them are abusive, oppresive, and exploitative.

I will not name any names, as most of you already know which companies I'm referring to. However, I would to leave you with this: no matter which country the company is based in, what products they sell, what industry they operate in, or how much money their marketing department receives, monopolies' cores remain the same: _maximum profit, minimum humanity_.
