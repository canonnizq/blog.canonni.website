Humans love graphics. In fact, more people self-identify as visual learners than all other preferred methods combined. In the mysterious and chaotic world of politics, the best way to visualize ideologies and governments is a **political compass**.

A compass, to put simply, is four large squares divided into smaller quadrilaterals. These shapes represent all humanly ideologies: fascism, marxism, welfarism, and even anarcho-capitalism. In my humble opinion, this idea is ridiculous, yet, I have found myself stuck within a mildly-sized square on the bottom left, named _social democracy_.

Today, like all who have wasted time and energy familiarizing themselves with the arbritrary squares, I introduced the concept to another. He understood after watching a short video of mine, which ironically means the compass has failed its intended purpose: to establish a eleborate framework to classify complex political ideas.

In addition to an audiovisual lesson, he took a so-called test to determine his political position, which turned out to be _left-libertarianism_. In my humble opinion, these tests are no better than tarot cards; their takers answer a few dozen questions, which supposedly reveal their inner political views, which are expected to last for the rest of their life.

If there's one -ism I believe in, it's _ismism_.
