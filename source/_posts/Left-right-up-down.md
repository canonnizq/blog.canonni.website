When I wrote about the political compass yesterday, I only mentioned one of its core aspects: subdivisions. Re-reading the poorly-written article, I realized that it only scratches the surface of the somewhat psuedoscientific system, and that its core remains the **two axises**, which intersect and make the compass resemble a algebraic plane.

The first axis, which happens to be the most commonly referenced, is that of economic policy, represented by the x-axis. The origins of this axis date back over a century, to the French Revolution, where the intelligentsia physically sat across the same parliamentary meeting based on their political positions; liberals left and royalists right.

As human societies moved on, and the issues of focus changed from beheading kings to climate change, so has the axis. Nowadays, the axis almost always refers to one's position on the relationship of state and economy; full state-controlled economy sits on the far left, while pure laissez-faire is located opposite of that. In most stable democracies, this axis is what politicians and theorists refer to when discussing candidates and their respective positions.
