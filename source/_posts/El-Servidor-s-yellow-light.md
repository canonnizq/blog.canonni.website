> This article is a copy of one of my essays on [El Servidor's Notion site](https://canonni.notion.site/El-Servidor-5409b5773a20482ea2d5ca908776b6c1?pvs=4).

**We have stopped at a intersection, waiting for the yellow light to shift its hue.** What does that mean? Read the entirety of this essay.

Over ninety percent of El Servidorians attend SHSID, which has recently started its 2024 school year; with that, the server has entered an ice age with minimal player activity and an inactive community.

As its owner and a member of its foreign school minority, I, like all other members whose usernames are on the scoreboard, wish for El Servidor for live on and not end up in the void of deleted files. However, most events and their results are uncontrollable for us, which is why, despite the ideal scenario not happening, we must find the next most optimal solution to the problem.

To quote philosopher Tony S.S., “The best solution is that which requires the least action.” In my humble opinion, I believe this issue can be easily solved through three tions, listed below:

- **Preservation** - El Servidor will indefinitely remain open for all players to play on. Its current save, maintained through daily backups, will be retained, and all configuration files, regardless of size or importance, will remain unchanged.
- **Migration** - Through my personal experiences with AWS, which I wrote about in detail on my blog, I have found that it, despite being a exploitative tech monopoly, is the best solution for hosting and maintaining small-scale servers. As such, the server and all its files will be gradually migrated to the new platform for performance and economic reasons.
- **Retention** - The server will use all its available resources to retain its most valuable asset, the players. Regardless of one’s skill, dedication, or conduct, El Servidor will do its best to make them stay in this vibrant yet harmonious server.

Those who know me well personally will know that I am fond of figurative language. In fact, all of my full-length articles and theories, both created independently and in collaboration with Stiffens, are written with metaphors in their core. This short essay is no exception, as I would like to compare El Servidor’s current state to that of a yellow traffic light: a brief stop, followed by a short halt, before turning green and letting traffic go in rapid speeds.

There is no need to worry or fear. All that you, fellow El Servidorian, need to do is to sit back, relax, and wait for the yellow light to shift its hue.
